# TripSg

TripSg is a personal full stack project that allow users to easily obtain their bus arrival information.\
 \
Most bus arrival apps require users to identify and select the bus stop they are at, either by checking a map or identifying the bus stop details from the physical bus stop. With QuickSearch, TripSg saves you that trouble by identifying the bus stop for you and returning the bus arrival information you need on a clean and user-friendly interface. \
 \
Frontend: React\
